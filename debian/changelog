nivlheim (1.9.2.git.2019.03.01) stretch; urgency=low

  * Initial release.
  * Depend on ca-certificates to get the ca-certificates.crt file.
  * Depend on libio-socket-inet6-perl and libnet-dns-perl needed by
    the perl client.
  * Make sure /etc/nivlheim/client.conf is not a conffile, and copy it
    on first time installation from /usr/share/nivlheim/client.conf.
    This allow cfengine to rewrite it without causing conffile questions
    on upgrades.
  * Depend on libio-socket-ssl-perl for IO::Socket::SSL and libwww-perl
    or libhttp-message-perl for HTTP::Request::Common used by the
    client.
  * Depend on libnetaddr-ip-perl for NetAddr::IP used by the client.
